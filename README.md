**basic.py**
This is extremely simple one.Here I connected the script to our OpenAI account.Then I asked the GPT 3.5 Turbo model to give a reply to the prompt , 
"write an essay about penguins" and the response was shown in the terminal.We can change the prompt and get the results.It's almost identical to 
using ChatGPT in the browser
